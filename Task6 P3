To create and compile a Java program with a package from the command prompt, follow these steps:

Create a folder for your package, and navigate into it:

mkdir mypackage
cd mypackage

Create a Java source file for your program and package. For example, create a file named MyClass.java with the following code:

package com.example.mypackage;

public class MyClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello from my package!");
  }
}

Note that the package declaration should match the folder structure: com/example/mypackage.

Compile your Java program with the javac command. Use the -d option to specify the output directory for the compiled classes:

javac -d . MyClass.java

This will create a com/example/mypackage/MyClass.class file in the current directory.

Run your Java program with the java command. Use the fully qualified name of the class to specify the package and class:

java com.example.mypackage.MyClass

This will output "Hello from my package!" to the console.

Note: To successfully run the program, ensure that the current directory is the parent folder of the package folder.
